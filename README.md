# Api Testing

Just a simple json file that I use for practice. 
Credits go to typicode for the creation of this server. 
all you need in order to replicate is a github account and a populated .json file 

#Usage

  Create a repo on you own account
  
  add a <yourfilename>.json file to it
  
  navigate to typicode's superawesome server 
  
  paste the file path after his domain
  
  you now have a json database to make posts and calls!
